I developed a Research Participant database using SQL along with queries for effective storage and management of data. I utilized languages like HTML, PHP, and CSS, to create an interactive and visually appealing webpage to access this database. I created 10 tables and 5 queries to explore these tables. I also included the option of users inputing ad hoc queries for further exploration of the tables.
